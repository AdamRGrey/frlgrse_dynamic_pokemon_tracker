# frlgrse_dynamic_pokemon_tracker
A dynamic pokemon tracker built on javascript intended to be used as a browser source.

This tracker is a free to use project and always will be. Use it in your youtube videos, twitch channel, etc. Alls I ask is credit back to the github project.

Please note that this version will be in 0.8.x during beta testing until I have finished testing all the code and am reasonably satisfied it is mostly bug free.  Once beta testing is complete, it will enter version 0.9.x.
